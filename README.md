tf2cfg
======

My Team Fortress 2 configuration scripts

Usage
-----

All common in-game settings (like sensitivity, field of view, and most keybinds)
are in mydefaults.cfg, which is executed by each class-specific config. The
autoexec.cfg file contains the technical settings and the configs that I only
want to execute once, like billnyetho.cfg, which would have its counter
reset every time I respawned otherwise.

Installation
------------

Clone this repository into a subdirectory of your TF2 custom folder. The folder
structure must follow ```Team Fortress 2/tf/custom/foo/cfg```
where ```foo``` is where you used ```git clone```
