My Team Fortress 2 configuration scripts

Usage
-----

All common in-game settings (like sensitivity, field of view, and most keybinds)
are in mydefaults.cfg, which is executed by each class-specific config. The
autoexec.cfg file contains the technical settings and the configs that I only
want to execute once, like billnyetho.cfg, which would otherwise have its counter
reset every time I respawned.

Installation
------------

Clone this repo to ```Steam/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom```. The folder
structure must follow ```Team Fortress 2/tf/custom/tf2cfg/cfg```. See
```Team Fortress 2/tf/custom/readme.txt``` folder for more details on mod installation.
